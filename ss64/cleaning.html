<p>Some tips on cleaning keyboards, mice, phone and tablet screens, and other similar high-touch devices.</p>
<p> A <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033217v2">recent study</a> shows the COVID-19 virus can last up to 24 hours on cardboard and two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/organizations/cleaning-disinfection.html">CDC states</a> that &quot;<i>cleaning of visibly dirty surfaces followed by disinfection is a best practice measure for prevention of COVID-19 and other viral respiratory illnesses</i>.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li> Don’t use wipes that contain bleach.</li>
<li>When cleaning a display screen, carefully wipe in one direction, moving from the top of the display to the bottom.</li>
<li> Surfaces must be completely air-dried before turning the device on after cleaning.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cleaning your Mobile Phone  from <b>Samsung</b>: <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00086342/">Q0086342</a> - <i>Use a disinfectant, such as a hypochlorous acid-based solution (containing 50-80ppm) or an alcohol-based solution (containing more than 70% ethanol or isopropyl alcohol). Do not apply these liquid solutions directly to your phone; they should be carefully applied to a microfiber cloth instead.</i></p>
