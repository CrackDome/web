<p>This page contains scripts that may be used to create 20 digit passwords on the command line. These are compatible with the online SS64 <a href="index.html">password generator</a> and will produce the same passwords.
<pre># Bash version
strongpw() {
    read -rs -p 'Encryption key: ' key
    echo '' # line break
    echo -n "$key:$1" | sha256sum | perl -ne "s/([0-9a-f]{2})/print chr hex \$1/gie" | base64 | tr +/ Ea | cut -b 1-20
}


# OS X bash version
strongpw() {
    read -rs -p 'Encryption key: ' key
    echo '' # line break
    echo -n "$key:$1" | shasum -a 256 | perl -ne "s/([0-9a-f]{2})/print chr hex \$1/gie" | base64 | tr +/ Ea | cut -b 1-20
}</pre>
<p> Written by Benoit Mortgat  who has also kindly provided a <a href="strongpw.zip">zip file</a> containing both a <b>bash</b> module and a <b>PowerShell</b> module. These can be loaded as part of your startup profile making them easily available.<br>
Also <a href="https://github.com/salsifis/ss64-password-generators">available on GitHub</a>, pull requests are welcome.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Command-line scripts can be an aid to cracking passwords. If you enter a password into a website which saves the password as <a href="https://plaintextoffenders.com/">plain text</a> (no password hashing) and if that website is subsequently hacked, the attacker would have one of your passwords. The attacker could then run a  brute force or dictionary attack through the same hash algorithm until they find a match with the first password, the attacker would then have your main password.</p>
<p>The way to protect yourself against this type of attack is to ensure that your Main Password is long enough (with enough <a href="../docs/security.html">entropy</a>) that such an  attack would  take an impractical length of time to complete.</p>
