Key
   -AllowRedirection
       Allow redirection of this connection to an alternate Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). 

       By default, PowerShell does not redirect connections.
       To also limit the number of times that the connection is redirected, set the
       MaximumConnectionRedirectionCount property of the $PSSessionOption preference variable, or
       the MaximumConnectionRedirectionCount property of the value of the SessionOption parameter.
       The default value is 5.
       For more information, see the description of the SessionOption parameter, and see New-PSSessionOption.

   -ApplicationName <i>string</i>
       The application name segment of the connection URI.
       Use this to specify the application name when you are not using -ConnectionURI.

       The default value is the value of the $PSSessionApplicationName preference variable on
       the local computer. If this preference variable is not defined, the default value is &quot;WSMAN&quot;.
       This value is appropriate for most uses. For more see about_Preference_Variables.

       The WinRM service uses the application name to select a listener to service the connection
       request. This name should match the URLPrefix property of a listener on the remote computer.

   -Authentication <i>AuthenticationMechanism</i>
       The mechanism used to authenticate the user's credentials:

       <u>Default</u> | Basic | Negotiate | NegotiateWithImplicitCredential | CredSSP | Digest | Kerberos

       The default value is  &quot;Default&quot;.

       CredSSP authentication is available only in Windows Vista and later versions of Windows.
       For more information about the values of this parameter, see <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=144382">docs.Microsoft.com</a>

       Caution: Credential Security Service Provider (CredSSP) authentication, in which the user's
       credentials are passed to a remote computer to be authenticated, is designed for commands
       that require authentication on  more than one resource, such as accessing a remote network share.
       This mechanism increases the security risk of the remote operation.
       If the remote computer is compromised, the credentials that are passed to it can be used to
       control the network session.

   -CertificateThumbprint <i>string
</i>       The digital public key certificate (X509) of a user account that has permission
       to perform this action. Enter the certificate thumbprint of the certificate.  

       Certificates are used in client certificate-based authentication.
       They can be mapped only to local user accounts; they do not work with domain accounts. 

       To get a certificate thumbprint, use the Get-Item or Get-ChildItem
       command in the PowerShell Cert: drive.

   -ComputerName <i>string</i>[]
       An array of one or more computer names. Creates a persistent connection (PSSession) to
       the specified computer(s). If you enter multiple computer names, New-PSSession creates
        multiple PSSessions, one for each computer. The default is the local computer. 

       Type the NetBIOS name, an IP address, or a fully qualified domain name of one
       or more remote computers. To specify the local computer, type the computer name,
       &quot;localhost&quot;, or a dot (.).
       When the computer is in a different domain than the user, the fully qualified
       domain name is required. You can also pipe a computer name (in quotes) to New-PSSession.

       To use an IP address in the value of the ComputerName parameter, the command
       must include the Credential parameter. Also, the computer must be configured
       for HTTPS transport or the IP address of the remote computer must be included in
       the WinRM TrustedHosts list on the local computer.
       For instructions for adding a computer name to  the TrustedHosts list,
       see &quot;How to Add  a Computer to the Trusted Host List&quot; in about_Remote_Troubleshooting.

       To include the local computer in the value of the -ComputerName parameter, you must
       start PowerShell with the &quot;Run as administrator&quot; option.

   -ConfigurationName <i>string</i>
       The session configuration that is used for the new PSSession. 

       Enter a configuration name or the fully qualified resource Uniform Resource
       Identifier (URI) for a session configuration. If you specify only the configuration
       name, the following schema URI is prepended:  http://schemas.microsoft.com/powershell.

       The session configuration for a session is located on the remote computer.
       If the specified session configuration does not exist on the remote computer,
       the command fails.

       The default value is the value of the $PSSessionConfigurationName preference variable
       on the local computer. If this preference variable is not set, the default is
       Microsoft.PowerShell. For more information, see about_Preference_Variables.

   -ConnectionURI <i>Uri</i>[]
       A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that defines the connection endpoint. 
       The URI must be fully qualified.

       The format of this string is as follows: 
          <i>Transport</i>://<i>ComputerName</i>:<i>Port</i>/<i>ApplicationName</i>

       The default value is as follows:
            http://localhost:5985/WSMAN
       Valid values for the Transport segment of the URI are HTTP and HTTPS.
       If you do not specify a ConnectionURI, you can use the UseSSL, ComputerName,
       Port, and ApplicationName parameters to specify the URI values.

       If you specify a connection URI with a Transport segment, but do not specify a port,
       the session is created with standards ports: 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS.
       To use the default ports for PowerShell remoting, specify port 5985 for HTTP or 5986 for HTTPS.

       If the destination computer redirects the connection to a different URI, PowerShell will prevent
       the redirection unless you use -AllowRedirection in the command.

   -ContainerId <i>String</i>[]
       An array of IDs of containers. New-PSSession will start an interactive session with each
       of the specified containers. To see the containers that are available, use Get-Container.

   -Credential <i>PSCredential</i>
       A user account that has permission to perform this action.
       The default is the current user.

       Type a user name, such as &quot;User01&quot;, &quot;Domain01\User01&quot;, or &quot;User@Domain.com&quot;, or
       enter a PSCredential object, such as one returned by <a href="get-credential.html">Get-Credential</a>. 

       When you type a user name, you will be prompted for a password.

   -EnableNetworkAccess [<SwitchParameter>]
       Add an interactive security token to loopback sessions. The interactive token lets you
       run commands in the loopback session that get data from other computers. For example,
       you can run a command in the session that copies XML files from a remote computer to the local computer.

       A loopback session is a PSSession that originates and ends on the same computer. To create a loopback session, 
       omit the ComputerName parameter or set its value to dot (.), localhost, or the name of the local computer.

       By default, this cmdlet creates loopback sessions by using a network token, which might not provide sufficient 
       permission to authenticate to remote computers.

       The EnableNetworkAccess parameter is effective only in loopback sessions. If you use EnableNetworkAccess when 
       you create a session on a remote computer, the command succeeds, but the parameter is ignored.

       You can also enable remote access in a loopback session by using the CredSSP value of the Authentication 
       parameter, which delegates the session credentials to other computers.

       To protect the computer from malicious access, disconnected loopback sessions that have interactive tokens, 
       which are those created by using the EnableNetworkAccess parameter, can be reconnected only from the computer 
       on which the session was created. Disconnected sessions that use CredSSP authentication can be reconnected 
       from other computers. For more information, see Disconnect-PSSession.

       This parameter was introduced in PowerShell 3.0.

   -Name <i>string</i>[]
       A friendly name for the PSSession. 

       You can use this name to refer to the PSSession when using other cmdlets,
       such as Get-PSSession and Enter-PSSession.

       The name is not required to be unique to the computer or the current session.

   -Port <i>int32</i>
       The network port  on the remote computer that is used for this command.
       To connect to a remote computer, the remote computer must be listening on the port
       that the connection uses. The default ports are 5985, which is the WinRM port for HTTP,
       and 5986, which is the WinRM port for HTTPS.

       Before using an alternate port, you must configure the WinRM listener on
       the remote computer to listen at that port.
       Use the following commands to configure the listener:

        1. winrm delete winrm/config/listener?Address=*+Transport=HTTP
        2. winrm create winrm/config/listener?Address=*+Transport=HTTP @{Port=&quot;<i>port-number</i>&quot;;}

       Do not use the Port parameter unless you must. The port setting in the
       command applies to all computers and sessions in which the command runs.
       An alternate port setting might prevent the command from running on all computers.

   -RunAsAdministrator
       When you use the -ConnectionURI parameter, the remote destination can return an instruction to redirect to a 
       different URI. By default, PowerShell does not redirect connections, but you can use this parameter to 
       enable it to redirect the connection.
        
       You can also limit the number of times the connection is redirected by changing the 
       MaximumConnectionRedirectionCount session option value. Use the MaximumRedirection parameter of the 
       <a href="new-pssessionoption.html">New-PSSessionOption</a> cmdlet or set the MaximumConnectionRedirectionCount property of the $PSSessionOption 
       preference variable. The default value is 5.

   -Session <i>PSSession</i>[]
       Use the specified PSSession as a model for the new PSSession.
       This parameter creates new PSSessions with the same properties as the specified PSSessions. 

       Enter a variable that contains the PSSessions or a command that creates or
       gets the PSSessions, such as a New-PSSession or Get-PSSession command.

       The resulting PSSessions have the same computer name, application name,
       connection URI, port, configuration name, throttle limit, and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
       value as the originals, but they have a different display name, ID, and instance ID (GUID).

   -SessionOption <i>PSSessionOption</i>
       Set advanced options for the session.
       Enter a SessionOption object that you create by using the New-PSSession Option cmdlet.

       The default values for the options are determined by the value of
       the $PSSessionOption preference variable, if it is set.
       Otherwise, the session uses the system defaults.

       For a description of the session options, including the default values,
       see <a href="new-pssessionoption.html">New-PSSessionOption</a>.
       For information about the $PSSessionOption <a href="syntax-preference.html">preference variable</a>, see help about_Preference_Variables.

   -ThrottleLimit <i>int32</i>
       The maximum number of concurrent connections that can be established
       to run this command. If you omit this parameter or enter a value of 0 (zero),
       the default value, 32, is used.

       The throttle limit applies only to the current command, not to the session or to the computer.

   -UseSSL
       Use the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to establish a connection to the
       remote computer. By default, SSL is not used.

       WS-Management encrypts all Windows PowerShell content transmitted over the
       network. UseSSL is an additional protection that sends the data across an HTTPS
       connection instead of an HTTP connection.

       If you use this parameter, but SSL is not available on the port used for the command,
       the command fails.

   -VMId <i>Guid</i>[]
       An array of virtual machines IDs. This cmdlet starts an interactive session with each of the 
       specified virtual machines. To see the virtual machines that are available to you, use:
        
        `Get-VM | Select-Object -Property Name, ID`
        
    -VMName <i>String</i>[]
        An array of virtual machine names. This cmdlet starts an interactive session with each of the 
        specified virtual machines. To see the virtual machines that are available, use Get-VM cmdlet.</pre>
<p>Standard <a href="get-alias.html">Aliases</a> for New-PSSession:<span class="code"> nsn</span></p>
<p>New-PSSession  creates a  PowerShell session (PSSession) on a local or remote computer.  When you 
create a PSSession,  PowerShell establishes a persistent connection to the remote computer. <br>
<br>
Use a PSSession to run multiple commands that share data, such as a function or the value of a variable. To run commands in a PSSession, use <a href="invoke-command.html">Invoke-Command</a>. To use the PSSession to interact directly with a remote computer, use <a href="enter-pssession.html">Enter-PSSession</a> . For more information, see <a href="get-help.html">help</a> about_PSSessions.<br>
<br>
You can run commands on a remote computer without creating a PSSession by using the <span class="code">-ComputerName</span> parameter of <a href="enter-pssession.html">Enter-PSSession</a> or <a href="invoke-command.html">Invoke-Command</a>. When you use <span class="code">-ComputerName</span> ,  PowerShell creates a temporary connection that is used for the interactive session or for a single command and is then closed.</p>
<p><b>Examples</b></p>
<p>Create a new PSSession on the local computer and save the PSSession in the $sess variable: </p>
<pre>PS C:&gt; $sess = new-pssession</pre>
