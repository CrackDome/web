<p>The  standard <span class="code">hosts</span> file on most operating systems can be used to block websites or redirect URL's to a different host (overriding DNS).</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons for editing this file, you can make an addictive social media site hard to reach or  prevent some scammy clickbait web site from getting even a single accidental page view from your machine.</p>
<p>Editing the hosts file is never going to provide much in the way of comprehensive anti-virus or anti-tracking protection, but if you just want to block a few websites from every web browser on your machine the hosts file provides a quick and easy way to do that.</p>
<h2>Location of the hosts file</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>MacOS / Linux / Unix:</p>
<p class="code">/etc/hosts</p>
<p>Windows:</p>
<p class="code">C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Editing the hosts file</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The hosts file is protected against accidental or malicious changes. therefore editing it will require administrator or SUDO rights.</p>
<p>From the command line <span class="code">sudo vi /etc/hosts</span> or launch a text editor 'As Admin', typically right click and Run as Administrator and then open the hosts file. In both cases you will be prompted for a password. On a Mac BBedit will automaticaly prompt to unlock the file.</p>
<p>Before making any changes, copy a backup of the hosts file somewhere else.</p>
<p>Notice that the hosts file does not have a file extension, (it is not hosts.txt) some text editors will only save a file without an extension if you surround the filename with quotes <span class="code">&quot;hosts&quot;</span></p>
<p>The default hosts file may have some comments and a localhost loopback which should be left alone.<br>
Additional lines can be added to the hosts file, one address per line:</p>
<p>The syntax is</p>
<p><span class="code">0.0.0.0 <i>web_url</i> #optional_comment</span></p>
<p>Each of the 3 parts must be separated by at least one space.</p>
<p> The first item is the IP address that we will 
redirect to, typically  <span class="code">0.0.0.0</span> or <span class="code">127.0.0.1</span> either of which will block the content.<br>
Blocked pages will 
return: &quot;<i>can't establish a connection to the server</i>&quot;. Any host name can be redirected to to any IP address.</p>
<p>The second item is the <i>web_url</i> to be redirected, and the third item is an optional comment.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In cases where a website works both with and without a<span class="code"> www.</span> prefix, then you will need to add a hosts rule for both urls.</p>
<p><span class="code">127.0.0.1</span> is the loopback address (also known as localhost).<br>
<span class="code">0.0.0.0</span> is a non-routable meta-address used to designate an invalid, unknown or non applicable target.</p>
<p>Using the  <span class="code">0.0.0.0</span> prefix may give a very <a href="https://superuser.com/a/949522/391480">small</a> performance benefit compared to the traditional loopback address <span class="code">127.0.0.1</span><br>
This is only likely to be noticable if you add thousands of lines to the hosts file.</p>
<p>On Windows, a very large hosts file will cause high CPU usage from the DNS Client. The performance degradation from a large hosts file, or from disabling the DNS client altogether,  is likely to completely negate the small benefit of blocking some urls.</p>
